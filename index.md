## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

Hi, I'm Matt, and this is my personal-website-cum-blog. It's pretty sparse right now, but I will be adding more content to it shortly.

I'm an incoming freshman at Stanford University intending to study Computer Science. I do not have a specific focus as of yet, but I've dabbled in web development, mobile, deep learning, and cryptocurrencies. It doesn't take much for something to capture my interest.

## ðŸ”§ Projects

I like making projects. Here are some of them:

* This very website, which is built on an open-source Jekyll template I made called __Artless__.
* __Aristotl__, a web app I built on the MERN stack with the goal of facilitating real-time communication between students and tutors. Admittedly a bit over-engineered, but it won Okta's inagural __Oktane Global Hackathon__.
* __express-save-data__, lightweight middleware for express that exposes Chrome's "save-data" header.
* __Sigbot__, a program that uses an LSTM neural network to write (quite poorly, might I add) "Jake and Amir" scripts. You can find some examples of these scripts in the Github repository.
* __SchoolElo__, a website that pits universities head-to-head, assigning each an Elo Rating. Take a look at those auto-generated SVG charts!
* __PacketBook__, a cryptocurrency wallet that works without an internet connection. This was built for my very first hackathon (nwHacks 2018), for which I won the SAP iXP prize. It also holds a special place in my heart as my first foray into serverless frameworks.

Also: not really a project but I was once a semi-regular contributor to __The Mifos Initiative__, a nonprofit that builds financial software for the billions of people in the world who are still unbanked. I mostly worked on their front-end app in Angular.js. I won the __Google Code-In Grand Prize__ for my efforts.

## ðŸ§  Interests

* Language, both natural and programming, and how humans communicate.
* Wellness and mindfulness. I try to meditate for half an hour each day.
* Digital minimalism and the effects of social media - how can we maintain the benefits of living in an interconnected world while also throwing away the anxiety-inducing aspects of digital life?
* Economics and how markets can be used to provide social benefit.

## ðŸ“– Books

My one regret in high school is that __I didn't read enough__. This summer, I'm doing my best to make up for lost time. Here are the books I'm reading or have read, along with a bit of commentary: 

* (In-progress) Statistics Done Wrong by Alex Reinhart
    * I'm only about halfway through this one, but I'm enjoying it so far. The book showcases a variety of statistical faux pas that scientists have unwittingly made. This book challenged me by making me take a more critical look at the scientific process and all the faults that lie within.

* (In-progress) Meditations by Marcus Aurelius
* The Robots are Coming by John Pugliano
    * A decent take on how automation will affect our lives. Unlike what the title suggests, the author takes a relatively optimistic stance. Although he occasionally draws conclusions that I think are a bit unfounded, his advice is sound.
* How To Lie With Statistics by Darrell Huff
    * A fun read overall. This book is from the '50s so I appreciated the references to polling in the [1948 Election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewey_Defeats_Truman). Doesn't go super in-depth, but I'm told it's a bit of a classic.
* Algorithms to Live By, by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths
    * Absolutely brilliant book. It brings new life and energy to some classic math/cs problems (traveling salesman, optimal stopping, etc.). Humorous as well!
